This repository now contains a minimal blog scaffold using Jekyll. It serves static HTML from the `docs/` folder so GitHub Pages can publish it from the `main` branch using the `docs` folder as the publishing source.

What you can do next:

- Edit the layouts in `_layouts/` and the stylesheet in `assets/css/style.css`.
- Add new posts as Markdown files in `_posts/` and they will appear on the homepage.
